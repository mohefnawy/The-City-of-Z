# Python script for interacting with Arches archaeological data management platform

# This script provides a conceptual outline for interacting with an Arches instance
# for archaeological data management. Arches is a web-based platform, and interaction
# typically happens via its REST API. You would need to have an Arches instance running
# and have appropriate API credentials.

# --- Configuration --- 

# Replace with the URL of your Arches instance
ARCHES_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8000/" # Example: "https://your-arches-instance.org/"

# Replace with your Arches API credentials
# In a real application, these should be loaded securely (e.g., from environment variables)
USERNAME = "your_username"
PASSWORD = "your_password"

# --- API Endpoints (Commonly Used) --- 

# You would typically find these in your Arches instance's API documentation
# Example endpoints (may vary based on your Arches version and configuration):
AUTH_ENDPOINT = f"{ARCHES_BASE_URL}auth/token/"
RESOURCES_ENDPOINT = f"{ARCHES_BASE_URL}resources/"
GRAPH_ENDPOINT = f"{ARCHES_BASE_URL}graph/"
