# Datasets and Research Papers Related to Amazonian Archaeology and City of Z/El Dorado

## Initial Dataset Search Results

Based on searches across Papers with Code, Figshare, DataCite, and Mendeley, direct datasets specifically focused on "City of Z (El Dorado) evidence" are not readily available. However, some related and potentially useful resources have been identified:

### DataCite

*   **Archaeological Sites in the Amazon Biome - Kaggle:** [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/josepart/archeological-sites-in-the-amazon-biome](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/josepart/archeological-sites-in-the-amazon-biome)
    *   *Note: This dataset might contain spatial information on archaeological sites within the Amazon biome, which could be relevant for broader analysis, even if not directly tied to the mythical City of Z.* 

*   **Geolocation of unpublished archaeological sites in the Peruvian Amazon:** [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-01067-7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-01067-7)
    *   *Note: This is a research paper, but it mentions geolocation data for archaeological sites in the Peruvian Amazon, which could be a valuable resource.* 

### Papers with Code

*   **Archaeological Site Detection in the Amazon - Kaggle:** [https://www.kaggle.com/code/adilshamim8/archaeological-site-detection-in-the-amazon](https://www.kaggle.com/code/adilshamim8/archaeological-site-detection-in-the-amazon)
    *   *Note: This is a Kaggle notebook/code, not a direct dataset, but it refers to recent papers and the potential for machine learning in detecting archaeological sites in the Amazon.* 

### Other Platforms (General Archaeological Data)

While not directly related to City of Z/El Dorado, these platforms host general archaeological datasets that might be useful for broader context or methodology:

*   **Mendeley Data:** [https://data.mendeley.com/](https://data.mendeley.com/)
*   **Figshare:** [https://figshare.com/](https://figshare.com/)

*Further investigation into the content of the Kaggle and Nature links from DataCite is recommended to determine their direct applicability.*



## Google Scholar Research Paper Results

Google Scholar searches yielded numerous research papers, particularly highlighting the use of LiDAR and remote sensing in Amazonian archaeology. While direct evidence for the mythical "City of Z" or "El Dorado" remains elusive, these papers demonstrate the increasing archaeological understanding of complex pre-Columbian societies in the Amazon.

### Key Papers and Articles:
